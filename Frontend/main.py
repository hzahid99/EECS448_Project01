#Things after here should be Zhenzhou's part, but he refuses to coordinate, and therefore, all GUIs, including this code, are involuntarily aborted. Already reported to prof and graders
#For project 2 group members: feel free to add the player GUI with this file and my placeShip and placeShipStart python files. My part is doing well, and finishing of the second part my teammate did not make it can make it pretty good.
